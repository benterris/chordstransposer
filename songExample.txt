Kurt Weill - Lost In The Stars
==============================


Before Lord God made the sea and the land,
  C         C°           D-7sus      G  G+
He held all the stars in the palm of his hand
   C6/E         A7b9         D-7         D-7b5
And they ran through his fingers like grains of sand
        C/E              Fmaj7  D-7   G7        C/G
And one little star felt alone
    C6/G D-/G  A7/G C°/G  G7

Then the Lord God hunted through the wide night air
         C        A°                 F/D        G7/B
For the little dark star on the wind down there
        C/E         A7b9        D-7       F-/D
And he stated and promised he'd take special care
       C/E        Fmaj7    D-   G7           C/G
So it wouldn't get lost again
      C-6/Eb       D-7b5   G7   C7   C6

Now a man don't mind if the stars grow dim
      Ab/F     Ab/F#        Eb/G       C-
And the clouds blow over and darken him
        Ab-/Cb               C-
So long as the Lord God's watching over them
  Ab/F         Ab/F#               Eb/G C-
Keeping track of how it all goes on
        Ab-/Cb          G-/Bb    A7  Ab7  G7

But I've been walking through the night and the day
    C         A°                  D-7sus        G   G+
Till my eyes get weary and my head turns grey
        C6       Ab13/C#      D-7        D-7b5
And sometimes it seems maybe God's gone away
    C/E                      F-6
Forgetting the promise that we heard him say
   C/E                         F-6

   And we're lost out there in the stars
(G)          F/G      F/C          C
Little stars,     big stars,     blowing through the night
A-7          A-7  Ab7       Ab7  C/G                 F#°
   And we're lost out there in the stars
(G)          F/G      F/C          C
Little stars,      big stars,        blowing through the night
A-7          A-/F# Ab7       Eb-6/Gb  C/G    D-/F    E°  Eb° //
     And we're lost out there in the stars, in the stars
D-/G           D-b5/G   C            Ab7/C         C6
